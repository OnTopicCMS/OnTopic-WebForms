# OnTopic Web Forms Adapter
Provides a basic implementation [OnTopic](https://github.com/Ignia/Topics-Library) for use with **ASP.NET Web Forms**.

> **Important:** This version of the library is obsolete. Ignia is no longer actively maintaining it, nor is it fully compatible with the latest version of OnTopic. It is provided exclusively to aid in migrations. Implementations should be updated to use the [ASP.NET MVC Framework](https://github.com/Ignia/Topics-Library/OnTopic.Web.Mvc) or, better yet, [ASP.NET Core 3.0](https://github.com/Ignia/Topics-Library/OnTopic.AspNetCore.Mvc) version.

## Presentation Layer
- **[`Ignia.Topics.Web`](Ignia.Topics.Web)**: ASP.NET Web Forms implementation, allowing templates to be created using `*.aspx` pages. 

## Credits
OnTopic is owned and maintained by [Ignia](http://www.ignia.com/).
